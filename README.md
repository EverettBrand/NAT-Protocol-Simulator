# NAT-Protocol-Simulator
Written in Python, this program runs private and public listeners to sniff out ICMP and TCP packets on each end of a network address translation interface. Packets leaving the clientâ€™s computer are picked up on the private interface where their private IP address and port number/ICMP ID are first stored in a python dictionary and then translated to a public IP and port number used as a key and sent out through the public interface. Once the server has received the packet and sent a response the public interface will pick up the response packet and translate the client's public IP address back to the stored private IP and port number. Finally the response will be sent out through the private interface andsent back to the client uing their original private IP and port number/ICMP ID.
